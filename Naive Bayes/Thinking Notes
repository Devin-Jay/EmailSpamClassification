Need a function that takes in a dataset, and calulates the:
    spamlikelis
    hamlikelis
    prior likelis

Need to split dataset into 80% training and 20% eval

Need to split 80% training dataset into 5 folds
    1. for each fold
        2. training use other folds
        3. use model created on current fold
        4. evaluate and save result

Use NaiveBayes class? (what's in it though?)
    initializes with attribute labels
    has a sort of main function, does the actual algorithm
    
    naiveBayes function -> takes dataset
        get the training dataset
        gets likelis -> calculatesLikelihoods
        applies likelis to test set - > evaluateModel
        returns evaluation
    
    use new model on test dataset

    evaluateModel function -> takes spamPrior, hamPrior, spamLikeliHoods, hamLikeliHoods, evalSet
        for each email
            loop through its attributes
                if the mail has the attribute
                    multiply by likelihoods
            multiply by priors
            add result to array
    return result

Pseudocode

import dataset
split dataset into 80% training and 20% eval
split training into folds
eval folds
    for each fold
        training use other folds
        use model created on current fold
        evaluate and save result
return result? IDK
