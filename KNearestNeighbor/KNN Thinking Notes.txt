Cosine similarity
closer to 1 means similar

class KNearestNeighbor
    takes in attribute labels

    evalEmail -> (email, trainingSet) -> predicts email classifier
        calculate |V| for email (so don't have to keep calculating it)
        for each email in the trainingSet
            calculate cosine similarity between evalEmail and currentEmail -> function?

    classifySet -> (evalSet, trainingSet) -> classifies set of emails

        loop through emails
            get predicted classifier -> evalEmail
