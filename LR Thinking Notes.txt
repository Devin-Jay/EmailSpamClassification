python gradient descent for linear regression no libraries

SSE = sum of (Y - f(x))^2
class LogisticRegression
    initialize with x values, y values, and learning rate

    function that fits line to graph

        initialize actualWeights to random numbers
        for i in iterations:
            set weightCalculations to 0
            for each email
                for each x in x values
                    update x value's weightCalculation using actualWeights
                        -> add ( learningRate * (target value - predicted y val) * current email's attribute value ) to x's weightCalcuation
            for each weight in actualWeights
                set x value's actual weight to updated x value's weight + current actual weight
